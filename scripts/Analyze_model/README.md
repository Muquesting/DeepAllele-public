# Model analysis

After model trainining, we will use analysis scripts to extract the learned sequence grammar of DeepAllele.

## Compute sequence attributions

### Sequence attributions with DeepLiftShap

DeepLift computes sequences attributions between the sequence of interest to a neutral baseline

### Sequence attributions from ISM and TISM

On the other hand, ISM and TISm compute sequence attributions within finite or inifintely small range around the sequence of interest. 

## Compute variant effects

## Extract seqlets from attributions

## Cluster seqlets

## Visualize motifs in tree

## Determine sequences for which model has knowledge

## Plot attribution maps for well-predicted sequences
