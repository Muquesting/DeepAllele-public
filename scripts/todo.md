# Analyze_model

- [ ] Check if giving motif locations to plot_attributions still works
- [ ] Provide plot_attributions to use predicted ISM from other file
- [ ] Put the trained model parameters on zenodo to download into models/ with wget
	- [ ] Have a download .sh
	- [ ] Have the same for processed data
- [ ] i.e. 2 ATAC, 2 Chip, 2 RNA + 2 inits
- [ ] Document pre-processing
- [ ] Should we use tangermeme? 	
	- [ ] We use dinuc shuffle and deepliftshap
- [ ] Include readfromckpt for load surrogate model
	- [ ] and potentially at other places
- [ ] Put sequences and attributions in npz together
	- [ ] Change input to other scripts
- [ ] Include scripts to extract variants and make variant calls.
